    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p><img src="images/profile.png" alt="Profile Picture"></p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am an Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia, specializing in the electrical engineering
stream!</p>
<p>I like getting my hands &quot;dirty&quot; with personal projects (quotes because my projects usually involve CAD or coding...) and
I'm always looking to expand what I know with them.</p>
<p>Outside my academics, I love music, especially jazz adjacent music. I've been particularly drawn
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@The8BitBigBand">The 8-Bit Big Band</a>, which I think may have stemmed from the great music in
Undertale that I grew up with.</p>
<h2>About my website</h2>
<p>My website serves primarily as a place for my blog posts to live, as well as a showcase of my projects.
Check out my 'Projects' tab for a high level view of complete projects, and the 'Blog' tab for anything that
doesn't quite fit in a final project.</p>
<h2>About Engineering Physics</h2>
<p>Engineering Physics at UBC is all about approaching the different aspects of electrical, mechanical, and software
engineering from a physics first approach.
While this means it contains a wide breadth of material, the strong analytical math and physics core keeps it focused on
bottom up problem-solving.</p>
<h2>About my specialization</h2>
<p>While the focus of my specialization is physics and electronics, I am familiar, and enjoy working with many other fields
of
engineering. From circuit analysis to statistical mechanics, Engineering Physics gives me a strong grasp on
fundamentals, and how to better integrate my contribution into them.</p>
