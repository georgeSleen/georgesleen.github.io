    <p>Recently OneDrive has been screwing with my files again,
and since I was upgrading to a one terabyte drive anyway, I thought that I would give linux a chance.</p>
<p>I had been using WSL for a while at this point for a better command line experience, and having had a little experience with Debian on a Raspberry Pi,
I felt pretty confident in switching over to a new operating system.</p>
<p>I did a quick search through different Linux distributions and wanted something that gave me a lot of the perks of using Linux,
while being well-supported and easy to troubleshoot. I'm happy to tinker with software until I get it working,
but this is the machine that I use personally and for school, so I'd rather not be wrangling drivers when a problem set is due in two hours.</p>

<p>I briefly considered Ubuntu, but remembered an old Linus Tech Tips video where he uses Mint and says it's been his favorite distro so far.
I checked out the distro and I thought it looked good, so I got a bootable USB flash drive ready and went to install Mint!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are still some things that you can't do without Windows.
SolidWorks in particular was a huge reason why I hadn't made the switch earlier.
So I decided to split my 1T SSD into three partitions: a 250G Windows partition, a 250G Mint partition, and a 500G data partition.</p>
<p>I went and installed the 1T drive into my laptop prepared to boot from the flash drive... but I ran into issues before even getting into the OS.</p>
<pre><code class="language-grub">Failed to open \EFI\BOOT\mmx64.efi - Not Found
Failed to load image: Not Found
Failed to start MokManager: Not Found
Something has gone seriously wrong: import_mok_state() failed: Not Found
</code></pre>
<p>This was the test to see if I was prepared to use Linux.</p>
<p>There were many suggestions online on why this was happening, the most common being secure boot being enabled.
I tried a bunch of boot options.
However, none of them seemed to fix it;
eventually I came across a solution that was to rename the file to boot from named &quot;grubx64.efi&quot;
to &quot;mmx64.efi&quot; which looking at the error message seems really obvious.</p>
<p>After this, though, everything was very smooth to set up.
I set up a Windows partition, attempted to install Windows without OneDrive,
but ultimately couldn't be bothered to jump through the INSANE number of hoops required to do so.
I just booted in and disabled it before it could &quot;help&quot; by adding more of my folders and files to OneDrive.
After that, I copied my files over from my old 500G SSD and set up the Mint partition.</p>
<p>I'd never realized just how much bloat is on a Windows installation until I opened up Mint,
and Mint is definitely <em>not</em> one of the leanest Linux Distros.
It was shockingly easy to set up all the software that I'd been using on Windows and configure it just how I liked.</p>

<p>I've been daily driving Mint for almost a month now, and while I enjoy it much more than Windows so far, I see why Linux isn't for everyone.
You don't <em>have</em> to be proficient with a CLI, but I think that it helps a lot to have that tool when you need it.
I also find that playing around with the OS is quite fun, even though I chose a fairly &quot;beginner&quot; distro.
For something that &quot;just works&quot; nothing beats OSX and Windows, although Linux Mint is quite close!</p>
