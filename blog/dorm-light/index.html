    <p>Late one night, in a procrastination-fueled productivity burst, I decided that I wanted to connect something physical to the internet.
While a door that automatically opens when I get close would be cool, I didn't feel like introducing a software vulnerability to where I sleep.
So calling on a recent memory of my friend telling me &quot;your dorm room light is always on&quot; I decided to hook up my light switch to the internet, so I could turn it off anywhere.</p>
<p>Arguably, it makes a lot more sense to just build turning off my lights into a habit and not wake up so close to when I need to leave, so I don't forget to do it - which I happened to do as I was building this project, rendering it useless.
I won't always have a janky wall mounted servo hooked into a web service, unfortunately.</p>
<p>But why spend 5 minutes doing something myself, when I could automate it in 5 hours?</p>
<p>So I went on to <a href="https://bc-robotics.com">BC Robotics' website</a> and searched through their IoT section.
I had my eye on the ESP32 because of it's Bluetooth capabilities originally, but I found an ESP8266 surface mount module for half the price.
Plus they had a little proto-board for it!</p>

<p>I needed a non-destructive way to actuate the switch. I spent a little time thinking and searching online and came across some 3D models for mounting a panel with a servo to a light switch.
Based on their designs I designed a super simple mount to fit the screws on the switch's mounting plate and sent it off to my 3D printer.
A few days later I got the board in the mail. I set up some simple supporting circuitry on the proto board, so I could power it on and connect a servo to it.
I added a 3.3 V linear regulator, a button connected to one of the GPIO, and a header for the servo to actuate the switch.</p>
<p>The button is for when I'm physically there, which flips the current state of the light switch, and the servo is connected directly to the USB 5 V rail.</p>

<p>I had a USB to UART converter handy, so it wasn't too bad to program the ESP8266. I also found <a href="https://io.adafruit.com/">Adafruit IO</a> as a really easy way to connect my board to the internet.</p>
<p>At least... that's what I thought.</p>
<p>I was visiting my parents place over reading break, which was when I did most of the programming.
I attached the setup to a light at home and tested that the servo and arm could actuate the switch, and that I could control it through the Adafruit IO webpage.
Everything seemed to work, and I was excited to take it back to university!</p>

<p>Not pictured is the USB cable used for power.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I got back to university, it turns out that I couldn't connect the ESP8266 to the campus Wi-Fi :(</p>
<p>Since I was using the Arduino IDE and the ESP8266 doesn't seem to support WPA2 Enterprise natively, I was stuck. Knowing what I know about networking now,
I think that I could have managed to implement a workaround, but at the time I was too busy with school to really sit down with it and create an actual fix.
So instead I made the ESP8266 a wireless access point, which unfortunately meant no controlling of the light anywhere, but at least it was working.</p>
<p>By the time I got this working though, I hadn't left my lights on when I was out once. So the only time the project really got used was to show my friends that I could actually control my light from outside my dorm.</p>
